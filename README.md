# Birthday App
Build a web app that will ask the user for a name and birthday.

When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:

- Wish the user happy birthday
- Tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday

### How to use
- Clone his repo to your machine 
- run 'bundle' 
- run 'rackup' 
- Visit localhost:[port number]

### User Stories

```
As a user 
So I can customise the web app 
I would like to be able to enter my birthday 
```
Object | Message 
-|-
User |
Birthday | Enter


```
As a user 
If my birthday is today 
I would like it to say HAPPY BIRTHDAY to me
```
Object | Message 
-|-
User |
Birthday | Today?
Message | 'Happy Birthday'

```
As a user 
If it is not my birthday 
I would like it to tell me how many days it is until my birthday
```
Object | Message 
-|-
User |
Birthday | Not today
Message | "?? days to your birthday"

### Status 
I have managed to display 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY (name)" if it is the users birthday and "??? Days to your birthday" if it isn't. I haven't calculated the days until the users birthday.
